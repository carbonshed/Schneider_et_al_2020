  ### Data
  
  **sub folder: "Viasala"**  
  **File headings: "synoptics2.csv"**  
  *the data in this file is used to create fig ?*  
  * Distance = distance from the outlet of the wetland (meters)  
  * Syn1_071819 = Carbon dioxide partial pressure (ppm) collected on 2019-07-18  
  * Syn2_072519 = Carbon dioxide partial pressure (ppm) collected on 2019-07-25  
  * Syn3_072919 = Carbon dioxide partial pressure (ppm) collected on 2019-07-29  
  * Syn4_073119 = Carbon dioxide partial pressure (ppm) collected on 2019-07-31

  **sub folder: "EosFD"**  
  **File: "All_Synoptic_Flux_Data.csv"**  
  *this data is used to create figure*  
  *headings:*  
  * Syn7-18  
  * Eos# = EosFd unit
  * Date = date of collection
  * Flux = Carbon dioxide flux (umole per m^2 per sec)
  * Distance From 35  = distance from the outlet of the wetland (meters)  
  * Syn7-25 = synoptic site number and collection date, July 25th  
  * Syn7-31 = synoptic site number and collection date, July 31st  
  * Syn8-6 = synoptic site number and collection date, August 6th  
  * Syn8-12 = = synoptic site number and collection date, August 12th
