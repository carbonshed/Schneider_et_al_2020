This repository serves to host data and analyses used in the research supporting the work in *Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) Fluxes from Terrestrial and Aquatic Environments in a Tropical Alpine Catchment*, submitted to *Journal of Geophysical Research - Biogeosciences*.

## Purpose  
  To provide access to the data and make analyses reproducible for others. All figures presented in the paper were created using R statistical software. All scripts and data files for creating our figures are provided within this repository. If you have Rstudio installed on your computer, you should be able to 'fork' this repository and run it on your local computer to reproduce the anlayses in this paper without any alterations.
  
## Instructions to run this code
This code was written and run with R version 3.6.2 and R Studio version 1.2.5001. You can fork or simply download this repository to your local computer and open the project file *Schneider_et_al_2020.Rproj*. We use the [here package](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here) to ensure that the code will run on any computer without having to change any file paths.
