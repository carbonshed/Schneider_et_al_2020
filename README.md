This repository serves to host data and analyses used in the research supporting the work in *Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Fluxes from Terrestrial and Aquatic Environments in a Tropical Alpine Catchment*, submitted to *Journal of Geophysical Research - Biogeosciences*.

## Purpose  
  To provide users access to the data and Rscripts used in to create publication figures  
  
  ## Guide to Folders  
  ### Data
  
  **sub folder: "Viasala"**  
  **File headings: "synoptics2.csv"**  
  *the data in this file is used to create fig ?*  
  * Distance = distance from the outlet of the wetland (meters)
